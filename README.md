## Diego, Jon, Kelan 

### Phase 1 roles:

* Jon - Design Lead
* Diego - Test Lead

### Phase 1 Notes
MainActivity will be the homepage with the requested modules 

Will do a check to see if the user profile was already created, and if not it will redirect to the input page

* Only two activities:
	*  Main (homepage) and profile(input/edit)

User will type in ther name, and all other information will be taken as drop-down menus

Activity level will be a dropdown menu, and user will be able to dynamically change their calorie needs based on what they have currently selected

Calorie inout in a drop-down item?

Activity level will be shown in a dropdown menu

Use metric units under the hood for height, weight, basal, etc. We can convert later.

* Stretch goal is to allow for selection between metric and imperial units at profile creation

Implicit intent to switch to google maps and search "hiking trails near {current location}", do the same thing for the weather

Put the profile picture on the left because it is cleaner with the edit button
